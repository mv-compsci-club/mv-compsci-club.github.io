        <h4>ArrayLists and Solving the Array Problem</h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>Monday, November 2, 2020 at 11:45 PM</h5>
        <p>In Java, you have learned or will learn about arrays, a data structure that holds various values. However, there is a slight problem with arrays. To explore this problem, we learned about ArrayLists, and then coded the Participants list on Zoom!</p>

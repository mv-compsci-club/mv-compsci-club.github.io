        <hr>
        <p><em>2/19/2019</em></p>
        <br>
        <p> After a long hiatus due to officer interviews, we're finally back to having meetings. We heard from a few of you that you guys liked the code-alongs and USACO style algorithmic lessons, so we started our Graph Theory series this Wednesday. Graph Theory is an insanely cool (and very real-world applicable) topic, but it requires some recommended prerequisites. Email us for more info.</p>

        <h5>Thursday, April 8, 2021 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>How do we put the code we made in the previous meeting in action? We used BFS to create an AI to solve the 15 puzzle! It was a lot of fun!</p>

        <h5>Thursday, April 1, 2021 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>Now that we've mastered the conceptual side of graph theory, it is time to code it up! We went through the code of BFS and shared the code.</p>

        <hr>
        <h5>Thursday, March 25, 2021 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>Not satisfied with DFS & BFS? We learned about two new algorithms that have build off of DFS but are much more efficient (in ceratin cases). Then, we used a visualization tool to see the algorithms in action!</p>

        <h4>Web Scraping with Selenium</h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>Thursday, February 11, 2021 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>Have you ever wanted your Java programs to get information from the internet? We continued our exploration of search engines by delving into web scraping, a process where an app can go into the internet and search webpages for specific information. We used a tool called Selenium to do this.</p>

        <h5>Monday, November 2, 2020 at 11:45 AM</h5>
        <p>In Java, you have learned or will learn about arrays, a data structure that holds various values. However, there is a slight problem with arrays. To explore this problem, we learned about ArrayLists, and then coded the Participants list on Zoom!</p>

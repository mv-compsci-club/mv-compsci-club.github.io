        <h3>When and where does the club meet?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For the 2022-2023 school year, the Main Division meets on Wednesday during lunch @ E204, and the ACSL Division meets on
            Mondays during lunch @ E204. This information may be outdated, so please check in with an officer to confirm the days.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What sort of experience is needed?</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul align="left">
            <li>
                <p style="text-align: left;">For the <em>Main Division</em>, none at all! We'll be teaching the ideas behind
                    concepts like encryption
                    and machine learning in an engaging way that beginners with little to no experience will
                    appreciate!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="text-align: left;">For the <em>ACSL Division</em>, a basic grasp of programming would be
                    useful (e.g. variables,
                    loops, methods, arrays). We will let you know what the prerequisites are in the meeting email.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="text-align: left;">In general, if you're feeling overwhelmed or confused about any of the
                    materials or prerequisites, come talk to us! We'll adjust the pace accordingly and give you the
                    necessary resources to understand the prerequisites. At the end of the day, even if you haven't
                    actually coded Topological Sort, learning how to <em>critically
                        think</em> like a
                    programmer takes you far into the real world to solve universal problems where the solutions aren't
                    on Slader.</p>

        <h3>Why should I sign up?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Signing up guarantees you an official member status. This status gives you access to member-specific
            information, like viewing upcoming meetings, being able
            to "check in" to meetings to show you were there and get points in the process, and enables you to apply for
            officer position.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What are points?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Points are a recent addition to the MVCS system, where we want to keep track of member participation in the
            club. They will be considered when evaluating officer applications at the end of the year, and for
            designating member privileges and roles within branches as well.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Points are (for now) gained through regular member attendance to meetings and by "checking in"
            when you're at the meeting. Another reason to <a
                href="https://tinyurl.com/join-mvcs-2022">sign up</a> now!</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How do I become an officer?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Officer applications will be sent out at the end of each school year. Factors considered when choosing
            officers are member attendance, participation in the meetings, and a holistic evaluation (by the entire
            officer team). Interviews for candidates will be conducted as well.</p>

        <h3>The Biggest And Best Tech Club of MV</h3>
        <hr>
        <p><b>MV Computer Science</b> is, to put it bluntly, the above. Founded
            in 2007 as MV Java Club, MVCS (rebranded
            in 2013) has expanded from teaching the Java programming language to
            embracing the arts that are computer
            science, coding, and the integration of both into technologies that
            make our life tick.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, we cover topics as varied as algorithmic programming (to prep
            for competitions like <a
                href="usaco.org">USACO</a>) to teaching computer science from a
            top-down perspective, and even web
            programming for educational nonprofits like <a
                href="http://www.learntobe.org/">Learn To Be</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We hope to not only promote tech-literacy, but also empower teens,
            young adults, and students to take up
            pursuits (and maybe even careers!) in technology. We have a lot of
            exciting stuff going on, and it's only
            going to get better from here</p>
        <br>
        <h5>And we want you to be part of the journey. <a

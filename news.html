        <h4>Coding Robots with Robocode!</h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>Thursday, January 7, 2021 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>To start this year with a bang, we used a program called Robocode, where we coded our own virtual robots and sent them to battle! After coding the robots, we shared our robots and the strategies we used to make them.</p>

        <h4>ArrayLists and Solving the Array Problem</h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>Monday, November 2, 2020 at 11:45 AM</h5>
        <p>In Java, you have learned or will learn about arrays, a data structure that holds various values. However, there is a slight problem with arrays. To explore this problem, we learned about ArrayLists, and then coded the Participants list on Zoom!</p>

        <h5>Monday, October 19, 2020 at 11:15 AM</h5>
        <p>We explored one of history's most ancient yet most efficient algorithms: GCD with Euclidean's Algorithm. We went over practice examples and then coded it up using a concept called recursion.</p>
